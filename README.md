<summary>üë®‚Äçüíª Solano's Coding Journey</summary>

<br/>

I started programming in 2019 during my technical studies, where I built my first e-commerce project using PHP, Bootstrap, and MySQL. That experience sparked my curiosity about how things work behind the code.

I initially enrolled in Production Engineering, but a single algorithms class was enough to show me where my true interest was. I soon switched to Computer Science, where I dove deeper into programming and found a real passion for Java ‚Äî the language I now work with and continue to study daily.

Since then, I've been focused on backend development, always looking to grow, build better systems, and turn ideas into solid, working software.
